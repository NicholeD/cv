          <<em>Operations Manager turned Web and iOS Developer.</em>
        </p>
        <p>I worked nine years operations in supply chain and enjoyed it thoroughly.
          Toward the end of that nine year stint I was managing am automation project
          for the company when I lost my tech support. I didn't have any coding experience
          and found myself neck deep in problematic code trying to catch the errors. As stressful
          as it was I found that I enjoyed problem solving and wasn't too bad at it. I enjoyed it
          so much that I quit my job to go to a coding bootcamp to change career paths.</p>
